Required dependencies:
python -m pip install matplotlib (installs matplotlib + numpy)

Instructions:

UNITS ARE ASSUMED STANDARD (N,m,Pa) or (lbf,in,psi)

1. Open existing .json file

2. Under "nodes" change the lists to correspond with the appropriate coordinates of the nodes
   ie. "nodes": [[node0 coords],[node1 coords],[node2 coords],...]
   eg. "nodes": [[x0,y0],[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]

3. Under "node_connections" change the lists to correspond with the start and end node of each element
   ie. "node_connections":[[element0],[element1],[element2],...]
   eg. "node_connections":[[start_node_element0,end_node_element0],...]
   The start and end node values correspond to the location in the list created above
   ie. [[0,1],...] -> element 1: start_node is node 0, end_node is node 1

4. Fill in the E (Young's Modulus) and D (Diameter) lists, each entry in list corresponds to the element
   ie. "E": [1000,500,...] -> element_0_E = 1000, element_1_E = 500

5. Set boundary conditions in "displacement" and "force" lists
   The displacement list contains a displacement list for each node in the system. In each
   displacement list there is an x and y component. Setting the value to 0 indicates a fixed
   boundary condition. If the value is non-zero, the solver will calculate a resultant displacement.
   ie. [[0,0],[1,0],...] -> node0 is fixed in x and y, node1 is fixed in y, can move in x
   The force list works the same way, a force of 0 will be ignored by the solver.
   ie. [[2000,-120],[0,0],...] -> node0 has a force of 2000 acting along a line at -120 degrees

6. In file: 492 Final Project.py change "file" variable to name of appropriate JSON file

7. Run 492 Final Project.py

8. Matplotlib chart of analyzed truss is generated
   Items to note:
   1. Elements are drawn as lines, element numbering is labelled
   2. Nodes are labelled at intersection of nodes
   3. Boundary conditions are generated as circles and triangles:
      - Circles indicate a fixed point in both x and y
      - Vertical triangles (point facing up) indicate pinned roller fixed in y direction, can translate in x
      - Horizontal triangles (point facing right) indicate pinned roller fixed in x direction, can translate in y
   4. Force vectors are displayed as dotted lines with a cross at the end point, annotated with the net force at
      the end point

9. Solution of displacements, stresses, and reaction forces are printed in the console
